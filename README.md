SSN bank program using Arrays to keep records

Write a program that keeps track of the social security numbers (SSN) of customers of a bank.
Assume that SSN is a four-digit number (ex. 1234 not 0123). Record SSNs in an array of 32 elements.
Use two functions: one to validate the SSN to check if its been recorded or not and another function
to list the records of SSN to show the user all the SSNs recorded in the program.
